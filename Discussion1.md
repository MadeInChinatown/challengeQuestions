# Discussion 1: Expressions, Statements, and Functions

> Follow us on Instagram at [@swift.learning](https://www.instagram.com/swift.learning/) !  Learn more about Swift with our guided content. We want to help you learn Swift if you've never written a single line of code or if you're a seasoned veteran.  Check us out!

## Warm Up - What Would Swift Do?

```swift
var x = 6

func square(_ x: Int) {
  return x * x
}

square(x) // What will be returned at this line?

max(2*2, square(-5)) - square(4) // What will be returned at this line?
```

## 1.0 Primitive Expressions

A *primitive expression* is a single evaluation step: you either look up the value of a name, or take the literal value.  For example, numbers, variables names, and strings are all primitive expressions.

```swift
2

"Hello World"
```

## 1.2 Questions

1. Determine the result of evaluating `f(4)` in Swift if the following funtions are defined.

```swift
func double(_ x: Int) -> Int {
  return x + x
}

func square(_ y: Int) -> Int {
  return y * y
}

func f(_ z: Int) -> Int {
  return square(double(z)) + 1
}
```

2. What will Swift print?

```swift
func a() -> String {
  print("a")
  return "hello"
}

func b() -> String {
  print("b")
  return "world"
}

print(a())
print(b())
```

## 2.0 Conditional Statements

1. Conditional statements allow programs to execute different lines of code depending on the current state.  A typical if-else
 set of statements will have the following structure:
```swift
if <conditional expression> {
  <statements>
} else if <conditional expression> {
  <statements>
} else {
  <statements>
}
```

The *else* and *else if* are optional and you can have any number of *else if* statements.  Here a conditional clause is something that evaluates to either `true` or `false`.  The body of statements that get executed are the ones under the first true conditional clause.  After a `true` conditional clause is found, the rest are skipped.

1. Write a simple function that takes in one input *x*, whose value is guaranteed to be between 0 and 100.  If `x` >= 75, then print "Q1".  If 50 <= x < 75 then print "Q2".  If 25 <= x < 50 then print "Q3".  If x < 25 then print "Q4".

```swift
func findQuartile(_ x: Int) {
  // YOUR CODE HERE
}
```

## 3.0 Iteration

Using conditional statements we can ignore statements.  On the other hand using iteration we can repeat statements multiple times.  A common iterative block of code is the while statement.  The structure is as follows:

```swift
while <conditional statement> {
  <body of statement>
}
```

The block of code literally means while the conditional clause evaluates to `true`, execute the body of statements over and over.

```swift
func countdown(_ x: Int) {
    var currX = x
    while (currX > 0) {
        print(currX)
        currX = currX - 1
        delay(1)
    }
    print("Blastoff!")
}
countdown(3) // What will this line print?
```

What do you think Swift will print for the following? `om` and `nom` are defined as follows:

```swift
func om(_ foo: Int) -> Int {
  return -foo
}

func nom(_ foo: Int) {
  print(foo)
}

nom(4) // What will this line print?

om(-4) // What will this line print?
```
