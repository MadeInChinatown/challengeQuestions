# Teaching Computer Science Retrospective

## What went well?
* We received the grant and the computers
* Some students  really enjoy it (Fred)
* Some students are starting to understand the fundamentals (Kelly, Brandon)

## What can we improve on?
* Students are not coming out consistently.
* Students are not understanding fundamentals
* There is a knowledge gap between students (Algebra 2 should be a prerequisite for taking this class?)
* There is a language barrier between instructor and student
* I need to convince myself WHY we are doing this and how this is a mutually beneficial experience for the students, organization, and instructors.
* Students are not having an additive experience.  They cannot conveniently save their progress between sessions.

## Concerns
* We are locked into this deliverable deadline.  Something has to be submitted by X day.
* If we want to meet this deadline at the quality that we want, students will be left behind.  We must accept that some students will not make it to the end of the course.

## Next Steps
* [ ] Finalize a mission statement
* [ ] Defining what success looks like.  Define metrics to measure our progress.
* [ ] Timeline a lesson plan with explicit start + end dates and deliverable deadlines.
* [ ] Communicate expectations from instructor to student and student to instructor.  What do we expect from each of these roles.

## Mission Statement

At the end of the class, your students should be able to:

1. understand the basic concepts of computer science
2. write and debug programs (aka exercise problem-solving skills)

## Defining Success

### Goals

* Students understand the following basic Computer Science concepts
    * Variables
    * Conditional Statements
    * For Loops
    * While Loops
    * Functions
* Each student who completes the computer science course submits a program deliverable and writeup on 1 of 3 topics
    1. Pedestrian Safety
    2. Census 2020
    3. Disaster Preparedness

### Stretch Goals

* At least one group of students will publish their project and findings publicly on Github.
* 75% retention from original Cohort.
