# Teaching Computer Science Retrospective

## What went well?
* We received the grant and the computers
* Some students  really enjoy it (Fred)
* Some students are starting to understand the fundamentals (Kelly, Brandon)

## What can we improve on?
* Students are not coming out consistently.
* Students are not understanding fundamentals
* There is a knowledge gap between students (Algebra 2 should be a prerequisite for taking this class?)
* There is a language barrier between instructor and student
* I need to convince myself WHY we are doing this and how this is a mutually beneficial experience for the students, organization, and instructors.
* Students are not having an additive experience.  They cannot conveniently save their progress between sessions.
* Student engagement - how can we make them excited about learning to code?

## Concerns
* We are locked into this deliverable deadline.  Something has to be submitted by X day.
* If we want to meet this deadline at the quality that we want, students will be left behind.  We must accept that some students will not make it to the end of the course.
* Student engagement - some blank faces and low motivation in the class. Can we somehow drive engagement by having sessions be more interactive, or have sessions produce a cool program/outcome? Something visual?

## Next Steps
* [ ] Finalize a mission statement
* [ ] Defining what success looks like.  Define metrics to measure our progress.
* [ ] Timeline a lesson plan with explicit start + end dates and deliverable deadlines.
* [ ] Communicate expectations from instructor to student and student to instructor.  What do we expect from each of these roles.

## Mission Statement

At the end of the class, your students should be able to:

1. understand the basic concepts of computer science
2. write and debug programs (aka exercise problem-solving skills)

## Defining Success

### Goals

* Students understand the following basic Computer Science concepts
    * Variables
    * Conditional Statements
    * For Loops
    * While Loops
    * Functions
* Each student who completes the computer science course submits a program deliverable and writeup on 1 of 3 topics
    1. Pedestrian Safety
    2. Census 2020
    3. Disaster Preparedness

### Stretch Goals

* At least one group of students will publish their project and findings publicly on Github.
* 75% retention from original Cohort.

## Lesson Plan Timeline

```
//TODO: Add lesson plan timeline
```

| Date | Key Topics | Deliverable | Homework | Comments |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1/26 | Class introduction, Motivation, Lesson 1 - Swift Constructs and Evaluation | N/A | ðŸ¤” | We should mention why we are rebooting the class. Also describe more what the goal is, and go over how the class will look from now on. |
| 2/2 | Lesson 2 - Swift Control and Higher Order Functions | ðŸ¤”| ðŸ¤” |  |

## Expectations

```
//TODO: List expectations between instructors, students, and administrators
```

It's expected that instructors:

* Provide a interesting and fun learning experience

* Provide a lesson plan outlining content & deliverables

* Assist students with any questions & concerns

* Provide equipment ready to go for the lesson

It's expected that students:

* Arrive to class on time, or notify administrators/instructors in advance of absence

* Make an effort to contribute to the class

* Work on their deliverable

It's expected that administrators:

* Provide equipment to the instructors and students for use in the class

## Thoughts

Sebastian: My concern is that we're not engaging the students enough. I feel like we need a more interactive class, and also have assigments and lessons that produce something in the end.
Even something minor like creating a button that does something when pressed.
We should also think about how to keep the students engaged during the week? I think @Alex you mentioned this before, but I like the idea (if we're sticking to iOS) of relating the things that we teach to apps that they know and are out there. Let's say if they are learning about collections/collection views, have them come back the next week with a short list of apps that they've seen using these components.
